to fork and create a pull-request.  


## Expectations and Version

Each release will be released with a nn.0 tag. Vulnerabilities fixes 
will be fixed and released as a nn.x where x is incremented 
sequentially with each patch to the 'nn' release.  

We do not release fixes for prior versions. Fixes for bugs and 
vulnerabilities will be added to the working version at HEAD and a nn.x 
version released.
