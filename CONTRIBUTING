		HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

Contributions from other developers are welcomed.

Please fork repository, make your changes and create a pull request.

want to add a feature that would involve significant work, please open 
a DISCUSSION post to discuss how the implementation would work.

Pull requests should not have any known bugs before the pull request 
is created. EXCEPTION: if there is a feature yet-to-be-implemented, 
please (1) mention this in the pull request comments, and (2) raise an 
issue of type BUG once pull request is accepted.


FEATURE ROADMAP

Please see the file ROADMAP for a list of features currently being
