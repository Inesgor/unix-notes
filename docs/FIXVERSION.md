# fixversion command

I have included a build tool that will compate versions and dates of the 
various files in this application.

## Checking versions and dates

```shell
$ fixversion
```

## Fix dates and versions

To change all the version numbers in the various scripts and man pages 
to the latest git tag version and current date run the following 
command:

```shell
$ fixversion fix
```
