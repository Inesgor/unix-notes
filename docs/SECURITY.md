# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the current version of this application. If you find an issue 
please upgrade to the latest version to see if the bug has been fixed 
PRIOR to creating an ISSUE.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a vulnerability is found please report this as an ISSUE in the 
Issues tab. If you have a fix or suggested amendment, please feel free 
to fork and create a pull-request.  


## Expectations and Version

We do not release fixes for prior versions. Fixes for bugs and 
vulnerabilities will be added to the working version at HEAD and a nn.x 
version released.
