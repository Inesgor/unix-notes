			PACKAGING NOTES SCRIPT

We welcome contributions from others helping to package NOTES for 
different BSD/Linux distributions.

CURRENTLY PLANNED BY AUTHOR

I will be packaging for the following operating systems, based upon the 
OS I have easily available to me:

- FreeBSD
- Debian Linux
- source tarball for use with 'make install'

OTHER PACKAGING DESIRED

We would love to see the scripts packaged for other operating systems 
including the following:

- Arch Linux 
- Manjaro Linux
- Ubuntu
- Fedora

We will incorporate packaging for any BSD/Linux that contributors would 
like to commit to building. 

PACKAGING

For ease of maintenance, packagers should create a sub directory under 
[repo]/pkgs named after the distribution (see pkgs/debian, pkgs/freebsd 
for example). 

Inside that directory there should be a makefile to create the package 
and all the appropriate files to create the distribution specific package 
file (.pkg, .deb, etc). 

It should be created in such a way that a simple 'make' in the folder 
to build the package according to the distribution requirements.

Please ensure that the package has the appropriate dependencies for end 
users. See the file DEPENDENCIES for details.
